This plugin and presentation combo will allow the user to play a specific tagged playlist in sync accross multiple Brightsign players.

2. Make a careful note for the name of the Tagged playlist that you have created in step 1 as you will need to enter that name as as User Variable later on. In my example the Tagged playlist name is "Sync-Tagged-playlist" (as per the above print screen)
3. Download the BrightAuthor:Connected (BACon) presentation "Tag-playlist-sync-Pres.bpfx"
4. Using the Mac/Windows BACon client set to "Local", open the "Tag-playlist-sync-Pres.bpfx" presentation
